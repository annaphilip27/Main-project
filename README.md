This project presents a low-cost, AI-powered assistive technology designed to aid blind and visually impaired (BVI) individuals in daily life. The smart glasses integrate ESP32-CAM, ESP8266, Python (YOLO + EasyOCR), and text-to-speech (TTS) to provide real-time object detection, text recognition, and audio feedback.
 Key Features

Real-time object detection using YOLO.

Text extraction (OCR) with EasyOCR and conversion to speech.

Dual microcontroller setup:

ESP32-CAM – image capture and processing.

ESP8266 – speech synthesis and data handling.

Python-based server for AI processing and Firebase integration.

Mobile app with voice assistant for interactive control.

Low-cost, portable, and user-friendly design for accessibility.

Tech Stack

Hardware: ESP32-CAM, ESP8266, PAM8403 Audio Amp, MEMS Mic, Bone Conduction Earphones

Software: Arduino IDE, Python (YOLOv8, EasyOCR, pyttsx3), Firebase, Android (Java/Kotlin)

Features: OCR, Object Detection, TTS, Voice Commands, Navigation Support
Objective
